\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\IEEEPARstart{G}{eospatial} monitoring systems are one of the most important tools for decision-making around various issues such as illegal mining, deforestation, border patrolling, and environmental surveillance. Having timely and specific information regarding the dynamics of phenomena that can be measured by satellite images supports the decision-making process at different time scales, allowing the implementation of proactive / predictive strategies.\\
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)

The automatic analysis of geospatial images supports the understanding of environmental phenomena, and human behavior, allowing to identify, prioritize, and explain events with high sensitivity and specificity in order to implement complete strategies for decision making.\\

In recent years, the performance of Artificial Intelligence techniques has presented a dramatic advance; This has allowed the emergence of innovative applications to problems in various areas, among them, the application of Kernel Methods and Deep Learning to Computer Vision problems stands out for promoting the creation of systems for decision making and classification, such as object recognition, classification of images by content and the development of autonomous vehicles.\\


In this sense, there are several reports in the scientific literature that describe the advantages of using classifiers based on Deep Learning in terms of the reduction in complexity of data pre-processing stages and obtaining quality measures at the state of the art level. This advance in the technique makes it possible to build systems for land use detection and classification for categories of interest without the need to establish reference frames, select spectral indexes or build decision trees manually. These components of the analysis are built and optimized automatically by the Deep Neural Network information and training integration system.\\

\subsection{Ideal situation}
Action upon sudden changes in the configuration of urban and rural geographic landscapes should be immediate and supported by the possibility of anticipating anomalous patterns over time. The detection of anomalies in the geographical landscape should be a semi-automatic process with the least frequency and the greatest coverage that the remote sensing equipment allows. Resources for the security of rural areas should be allocated optimally, providing timely responses and prioritizing incidents.\\

\subsection{Problem}
In Colombia, problems such as illegal crops, illegal mining, deforestation and border surveillance do not have automatic or manual information and analysis on short time scales (less than a week) over the entire national territory. At present, the ability to anticipate anomalous patterns over time in satellite images is limited by restrictions on the availability of specialized personnel, computational resources and information sources. Available commercial offers do not allow the use of remote sensing data from open sources with effectiveness and reasonable costs.\\

\subsection{Hypothesis}
Having tools based on Artificial Intelligence for automatic monitoring and early warning generation for problems with geospatial manifestation, would allow to prioritize incidents, optimize the allocation of resources, and establish proactive strategies for surveillance, control, and application of laws and norms over the national territory. It would allow the timely deployment of personnel and prioritization of actions on issues such as illegal mining, illegal crops, illegal occupation of national parks, deforestation, fires, floods, and border surveillance according to a mapping and diagnosis processes for the identification and targeting of environmental and human phenomena.\\

\subsection{Goal}

In this project we explore the combination of kernel methods and deep learning techniques for the automatic classification of geospatial images.\\

We aim to take advantage of the strengths of deep convolutional neural networks and their translation into convolutional kernel networks. This combination has the potential to improve existing performance on the task of land cover classification, and object detection in remote sensing imagery.

\subsection{Scope}
We plan to use a publicly available dataset on image feature detection. This dataset must have an existing baseline based on manual and automatic labeling.\\

We will use available implementations of the baseline methods and Convolutional Kernel Networks. It is expected that we will need to make minor adjustments and write code with the purpose of adapting existing code to our computational setup, and for the analysis of results. \\

\section{Literature review}

The availability of satellite imagery for every corner of the planet has enabled several applications that could not be feasible with other types of observation techniques. At the same time, the volume of continuously updated and historical data represents a challenge for the analysis, which can not be possible without automation \cite{maggiori2016convolutional}.\\

Among  image processing tasks in geospatial analysis, object detection and classification is one of the most common steps. Object detection and classification allows to quantify terrain features with significance in a particular problem for each unit of analysis. At its turn, this measurements are used as inputs for different models, with applications in diverse domains such as environmental, industrial, agricultural, epidemiological, national security, and economic planning \cite{maggiori2016convolutional}.\\


The state of the art in image processing techniques for object detection and classification makes use of convolutional neural networks. These type of network, originally proposed in 1980 \cite{fukushima1980neocognitron}, had a tremendous growth of use for several image processing in the 2000s. Factors that contribute to their widespread use are the currently available computing capability (Graphical Processing Units), existence of large enough datasets for training, and good performance for diverse tasks \cite{liu2017survey}.\\

Another artificial intelligence techniques that have been used widely for computer vision are the kernel methods  \cite{LampertKernel} which are based on a implicit projection of the images into a high dimensional Hilbert space, where the data can be linearly related. One of the  main advantages of kernel methods over neural networks is the possibility of include knowledge about the field, however, the main disadvantage is the lack of scalability to large datasets.\\

Ideally, strategies that combine the advantages of kernel methods and neural networks can be very useful in computer vision field. Recently, some advances about this have been made with the development of Convolutional Kernel Networks (CKN) \cite{NIPS2014_5348} which are based on a deep architecture of kernel machines instead of a shallow one. The main idea is to put kernel functions as layers in a network and analyse images in a convolutional way, i.e. through patches in each layer.\\

Convolutional Kernel Networks have showed good performance for computer vision tasks compared to Convolutional Neural Networks. In fact, it can be shown that a CNN architectures can be translated into a CKN ones defining a similar translational invariations by the concatenation of convolutional layers \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1904-03955}.\\ 

\section{Case study}

We took two case studies as references for the methodology, datasets, and utility aspects for this project: the methodology technical report of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Sistema Integrado de Monitoreo de Cultivos Ilícitos (SIMCI), which is the most authoritative source of illegal crops, and illegal minery for Colombia making use of geospatial analysis \cite{Nevada2017MetodologiaCoca}; and the Kaggle competition "Dstl Satellite Imagery Feature Detection" which was proposed around a feature detection dataset \cite{kaggledstl2017}.\\

The UNODC SIMCI report \cite{UNODC2017Monitoreo2017} makes use of a traditional methodology, in which additional data sources are used as manual reference only. They defined a decision tree that allowed to select a pool of candidate zones for illicit crops. This pool was further refined, and the report was made by augmenting the manually curated data with historical records.\\

The Kaggle competition on object detection and classification launched in 2017, given its online nature and the technological tools that allow the sharing and reproducibility of solutions, is associated with a wide variety of solutions for the proposed problem. The dataset (which we chose to use in this project and is described in the following section) is publicly available, as well as solutions using different techniques, from SVMs to Convolutional Neural networks. This case study is ideal because it has several performance baselines.

\section{Training data set}

For the purposes of the competition \cite{kaggledstl2017}, Dstl provides 1km x 1km satellite images in both 3-band and 16-band formats, with the goal for detection and classification of objects found in these regions. The satellite that took this images is WorldView-3. The 3-band images are RGB natural color omages. The 16-band images contain additional spectral information. These images are provided in the GeoTiff format.\\

There are 10 different object types annotated in the dataset:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Buildings}
    \item{Miscellaneous man-made structures}
    \item{Roads}
    \item{Tracks}
    \item{Trees}
    \item{Crops}
    \item{Waterways}
    \item{Standing water}
    \item{Large vehicles}
    \item{Small vehicles}
\end{itemize}

These objects are described by a polygon and a type in GeoJSON and WKT formats. The original coordinates of the images are replaced by a [0, 1] coordinate system. The dataset size is 20GB.

%There are several sources of geospatial information, among them Landsat, MODIS, and Sentinel stand out. The latter and  %most recent, from the European Space Agency develops latest technology missions for earth observation. Sentinel-2 %consists of two satellites that provide high resolution optical images, with monitoring objectives of vegetation, soil, %%coastal areas, among others. Sentinel-3 is centered on the topography, temperature and color of the surface of the sea %and the earth. Sentinel-2 has a spatial resolution of 10m and time of approx. 5 days; Sentinel-3 has a spatial %resolution of approximately 3 days and 300m. It is possible to perform timely monitoring of highly dynamic %environmental, agricultural or ecological phenomena.\\

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.




%\section{Conclusion}
%The conclusion goes here.





% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
%


%\appendices
%\section{Proof of the First Zonklar Equation}
%Appendix one text goes here.

% you can choose not to have a title for an appendix
% if you want by leaving the argument blank

%Appendix two text goes here.


% use section* for acknowledgment

% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent

% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
%\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:

%\begin{IEEEbiography}{Michael Shell}
%Biography text here.
%\end{IEEEbiography}

% if you will not have a photo at all:
%\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{John Doe}
%Biography text here.

% insert where needed to balance the two columns on the last page with
% biographies
%\newpage

%\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{Jane Doe}
%Biography text here.
%\end{IEEEbiographynophoto}

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.

% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
